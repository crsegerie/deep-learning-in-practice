# deep-learning-in-practice

You can find here an implementation of the GradCam Algorithm, an implementation of the Graph Neural Network with some pretty schema of the utility and similarity attention for graph neural networks, and finaly an analysis of the dynamical system like the rossler system analysed with some dynamical neural networks.
